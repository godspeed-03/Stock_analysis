# Stock Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of stock data using Python. The primary goal is to fetch, analyze, and visualize historical stock prices for several technology companies. The analysis includes calculating moving averages, visualizing stock performance, and conducting a Monte Carlo simulation to predict future stock prices.

## Libraries and Packages

### 1. **Pandas**

- **Description**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like `DataFrame` and `Series` for efficiently handling and analyzing data.
- **Usage**: Used for handling and processing stock data, including fetching, cleaning, and analyzing data.

### 2. **NumPy**

- **Description**: NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Usage**: Used for numerical operations, including generating random values for simulations and calculating statistical metrics.

### 3. **Matplotlib**

- **Description**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Usage**: Used for plotting stock prices, moving averages, volume, and other financial metrics.

### 4. **Seaborn**

- **Description**: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **Usage**: Used for creating advanced plots like histograms, joint plots, and heatmaps to visualize the distribution and relationships between stock returns.

### 5. **yfinance**

- **Description**: yfinance is a library that provides access to Yahoo Finance data. It is used to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Usage**: Used to fetch historical stock price data for the analysis.

### 6. **datetime**

- **Description**: The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
- **Usage**: Used to define and handle the time period for fetching stock data and performing analysis.

## Analysis Overview

### Data Fetching

Stock data is fetched using the `yfinance` library. The project focuses on technology stocks, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). Data is retrieved for a specified date range starting from October 1, 2023, to the current date.

### Data Visualization

- **Closing Prices**: Plotted the closing prices for Apple (AAPL) to visualize historical performance.
- **Volume Prices**: Plotted the trading volume for AAPL.
- **Moving Averages**: Calculated and plotted 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages for AAPL to analyze trends.
- **Daily Returns**: Calculated and plotted daily returns to understand the volatility of the stock.

### Correlation and Pairwise Analysis

- **Correlation Matrix**: Computed and visualized the correlation matrix to examine the relationships between the daily returns of different stocks.
- **PairGrid**: Used to create pairwise plots for a comprehensive visual analysis of stock returns.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

- **Simulation**: Performed a Monte Carlo simulation to predict future stock prices for Google (GOOG). This involves simulating random price paths based on historical volatility and expected returns.
- **Quantile Analysis**: Analyzed the distribution of simulated end prices to assess the potential risk and value at risk (VaR).
